# Eat-Da-Burger Application - Node Express Handlebars

## Overview
The Eat-Da-Burger application is created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant application that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, eat the burgers, then re-order their favorites! 

## What can the user do on this application? 
* Type the name of a burger in the *Place Burger Order Here* section and click *Add Burger to Order* button.
* Click on the *Devour It* button in the *Burgers that Need to be Eaten* section to eat a burger. 
* Click on the *Order Again* button in the *Eaten Burgers* section to order it again.

## Data
The existing burger data and the user's new burger data all live within a MySQL database: *burgers_db*. The *burgers* table within the database is populated and updated by the user's actions.
